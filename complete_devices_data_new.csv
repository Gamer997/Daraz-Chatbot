Extremely powerful, awesome like you've never seen before
Using TSMC's precise 4nm process with super-high integration for a powerful performance, tens of billions of mass-integrated transistors equipped with an innovative development resource architecture, provide better adaptation and lower power consumption, regardless of whether you're working, gaming, or creating. Its strength should not be underestimated.

Leica main camera
Coupled with a super-sized sensor to bring a more delicate texture to your photographs and preserve the stories in every moment of light and shadow wonderfully.

Leica ultra-wide camera
The 15mm equivalent focal length creates an amazing sense of space, capturing more wonder and displaying more character tension in each shot.

Pro HDR display Ultra-dynamic display
The Xiaomi 13T Pro's ultra-dynamic display technology can increase brightness up to 5 times that of traditional displays. It can accurately identify HDR areas, use dynamic masks to darken the brightness of non-HDR areas, and smoothly transition between different areas of brightness for better images.

With Pro HDR display
Without Pro HDR display

High-frequency dimming is more eye-friendly when using a phone at night
Up to 2880Hz PWM dimming surpasses the stroboscopic perception of the human eye, reducing visual fatigue caused by flickering and taking better care of your eyes.
